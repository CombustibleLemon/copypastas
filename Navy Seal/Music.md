What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I dropped out of high school and have 300 confirmed scrobbles of John Cage. I run a blog that gets 12 views per day and I only listen to music in FLAC. You are nothing to me but just another sage. I will destroy your reputation here, mark my fucking words. I have 12 identical images of an animated sun that I'm prepared to dump in your thread. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am greentexting what you previously wrote and am about to ask you to define certain words you used even though everybody knew exactly what you meant. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can derail a thread with a single post. Not only have I listened to every classic Krautrock album, I've listened to the Scaruffi top 25, the RYM top 100, all of the patriciancore list -- you fucking name it. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will sage you and you will wallow in your anger for the rest of your pathetic day. You're fucking reported, kiddo.
