A neo-liberal White Christian NRA Lawyer Professor and Capitalist Slaver was teaching a class on economics.

“Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Mises and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, internationalist, pro-socialism Peshmerga champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of communism and fully supported all worker movements in the world stood up and held up a red flag.

“But what about the material conditions?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Fascistly and smugly replies “Human Nature”

“Wrong. Humans have only engaged socially in classes for the past 10,000 years, but lived communally for hundreds of thousands of years before that. If Capitalism was human nature like you say... we would have been engaging in commodity production for a million years already”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of *The Wealth of Nations.* He stormed out of the room crying those neo-liberal vulture tears.

The students applauded and all registered Communist that day and accepted Marx as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Classlessness” flew into the room and perched atop the Red Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The Internationale was sung several times, and Lenin himself showed up and enacted Glorious Revolution across the whole country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He was arrested for being a slaver and was tossed in a Gulag for all eternity

####Viva la Revolucion!
